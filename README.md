# TopUrl

------

TopUrl is my solution to PingCap homework. What I want to talk about is:

> * The problem description
> * My summarization of solution
> * How to use my programe
> * The details about my code


## The Problem Description
    Given 100GB file(s), you should find out the 100 urls which have the most frequency.  

## My summarization of solution


### 1. Assumption
    To be more strict, I just assume that the file is a big txt file, and every line has a url. And I assume the OS environment is Linux. 
    
### 2. Idea
    I think the paper [MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters][1] is very wonderful.
